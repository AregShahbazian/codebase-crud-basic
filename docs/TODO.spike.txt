    Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
        you can immediately call a function as you declare it by making the declaration an expression
        line starting with 'function' is a declaration
    Revealing Module pattern
        assign the declaration to a variable, and it's a constructor and can be used to create modules with 'new' keyword
        surround the declaration with parenthesis, and it's an expression
    Pre-ES6 patterns also define modules:
        AMD (browsers), CJS (nodeJs) and UMD (browser and nodejs), Global
    ES6 uses export
    Module loaders load modules on the fly (default way)
    Module bundlers bundle modules in a single file during build
        Browserfy
        Webpack
