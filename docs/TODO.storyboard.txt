HISTORY

Setup redux-form and react-widgets
    examples
        https://redux-form.com/7.0.4/docs/gettingstarted.md/
        https://redux-form.com/7.0.4/examples/react-widgets/
    localization
        https://github.com/jquense/react-widgets/blob/v4/packages/docs/components/pages/i18n.md


Accessing PropTypes via the main React package is deprecated, and will be removed in  React v16.0. Use the latest available v15.* prop-types package from npm instead. For info on usage, compatibility, migration and more, see https://fb.me/prop-types-docs
    We're fine
        https://fb.me/prop-types-docs
        "Code like this is still fine:"


Implement form-fields using redux-form
    https://redux-form.com/7.0.4/examples/react-widgets/

    configure Globalize to support NumberPicker

    found out because:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-widgets-moment-localizer
    ("... if you plan on using the NumberPicker ...")

        Webpack Globalize plugin is necessary
            because: https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize/issues/603
            documentation:  https://github.com/rxaviers/globalize-webpack-plugin
            example:        https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize/tree/master/examples/app-npm-webpack

                            http://jquense.github.io/react-widgets/localization/

    Initializing redux-form values from state:
        https://redux-form.com/7.1.1/examples/initializefromstate/
            set initialValues in props


    No react-widgets for now (style=overkill). just Field


Implement stubs in wiremock
    GET /author
    GET /author/{id}
    POST /author
    PATCH /author/{id}
    PUT /author/{id}
    DELETE /author/{id}
