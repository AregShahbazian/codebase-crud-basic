Setup redux-form and react-widgets
    examples

Accessing PropTypes via the main React package is deprecated, and will be removed in  React v16.0. Use the latest available v15.* prop-types package from npm instead. For info on usage, compatibility, migration and more, see https://fb.me/prop-types-docs
    We're fine
        https://fb.me/prop-types-docs
        "Code like this is still fine:"

var vs let:
    var is scoped to nearest function
    let is scoped to nearest block

what's UMD/AMD/cjs?
    https://www.jvandemo.com/a-10-minute-primer-to-javascript-modules-module-formats-module-loaders-and-module-bundlers/
    Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
        you can immediately call a function as you declare it by making the declaration an expression
        line starting with 'function' is a declaration
    Revealing Module pattern
        assign the declaration to a variable, and it's a constructor and can be used to create modules with 'new' keyword
        surround the declaration with parenthesis, and it's an expression
    Pre-ES6 patterns also define modules:
        AMD (browsers), CJS (nodeJs) and UMD (browser and nodejs), Global
    ES6 uses export
    Module loaders load modules on the fly (default way)
    Module bundlers bundle modules in a single file during build
        Browserfy
        Webpack

how do webpack plugins work?
    Webpack plugins run custom code at compile time.

how doe the Webpack Globalize Plugin plugin work?
    It makes the program load CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) data on DEV or compiled data on PROD
    location/format of custom messages can be given as 'mesages' parameter to the plugin construtor
    location/format of output of production build can be specified in 'output' parameter
